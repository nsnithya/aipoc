# Text-To-SQL 

The following repsository contains the code that was used in the text-to-sql portion of the resume database project. Text-to-sql is the problem of converting natural 
language questions into appropriate sql queries using large language models, which can then be used to query the corresponding database. The goal of this project is to 
provide the means of quering a given database without the need to learn the SQL expression language. The model that was used in this project was Llama 2. In particular
the 7B-chat variant was used. For more information about these models go here:
