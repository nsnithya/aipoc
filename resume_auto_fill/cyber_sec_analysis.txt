Hardcoded AWS Access Credentials:

    Issue: The AWS credentials are hardcoded.
    Recommendation: Use IAM roles or store credentials in environment variables.

Unrestricted File Types & Data Input and Validation:

    Issue: Unchecked file uploads of various types.
    Recommendation: Validate file contents, integrate malware scanning, and sanitize content.

Static Seed Initialization:

    Issue: Predictable seed for randomization.
    Recommendation: Use dynamic seeding.

Unsecured External Service Call & External Service Calls:

    Issue: Unencrypted and unauthenticated external POST request.
    Recommendation: Use HTTPS, validate certificates, and avoid hardcoding IPs.

Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability:

    Issue: Unvalidated user input for file paths.
    Recommendation: Validate and sanitize user inputs.

Error Handling & Error Handling:

    Issue: Insufficient error handling.
    Recommendation: Implement robust error handling without exposing details.

Static S3 Bucket Name:

    Issue: Hardcoded S3 bucket name.
    Recommendation: Use secure configuration management.

Appending to CSV without Verification:

    Issue: Unverified data appended to CSV.
    Recommendation: Validate and sanitize data before appending.

Inefficient S3 Uploads:

    Issue: Repeated S3 uploads.
    Recommendation: Opt for batch uploads or more efficient mechanisms.

Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Vector & Service Availability:

    Issue: Potential for DoS attacks.
    Recommendation: Implement rate-limiting and file size checks.

Print Statements:

    Issue: Data leakage via print statements.
    Recommendation: Limit print statements in production and use secure logging.

Data Storage and Handling:

    Issue: Unencrypted data storage.
    Recommendation: Encrypt data and avoid predictable filenames.

Regular Expressions:

    Issue: Potential ReDoS through regex.
    Recommendation: Ensure safe regex patterns.

Code Complexity and Maintainability:

    Issue: Complex methods.
    Recommendation: Refactor into smaller, focused functions.

Static Files:

    Issue: Unchecked reference to specific files.
    Recommendation: Validate file presence and integrity.

JSON Handling:

    Issue: Unvalidated JSON input from query parameters.
    Recommendation: Validate JSON and use POST over GET for large data.

Dependencies:

    Issue: Potential outdated/vulnerable libraries.
    Recommendation: Regularly update and check for vulnerabilities.

Authentication and Authorization:

    Issue: Lack of authentication/authorization checks.
    Recommendation: Implement standard authentication and authorization methods.

        "Likelihood": 9, 
        "Severity": 9,
        "Potential Attack": "Unauthorized access to AWS resources. By having hardcoded AWS credentials in the codebase, an attacker who gains access to the source code or intercepts these credentials can exploit AWS services, potentially gaining access to data,             incurring high costs, or affecting service availability."
